								<h2>Hello, I'm Jessica :)</h2>
							</header>
							<p>As a mere nineteen year old college student, I'm just starting to find my way around.
							I still stare at the world in wonder, absorbing the spectacularity of our lives.</p>
							<p>Usually, I spend my time grasping the new knowledge that my classes present to me. Admittedly, the 
							curriculum is intense, but I also relish every challenge I'm given. 
							In fact, my interest in Computer Science initially grew from the satisfaction I experienced through every
							math problem I solved. You may find it surprising, though, that my ultimate decision to enter
							the field of computer science was due to my love for art. </p>
						</div>
						<span class="image2"><img src="images/self.jpg" alt="" /></span>
					</div>
					<p>As much as I loved math, I had an equally budding passion for art. In some instances,
					math felt extremely constricting; after all, it's a subject composed of algorithms and obscure
					equations. Art, on the other hand, exposed me to the unlimited bounds of imagination, creativity, and
					freedom.</p>
					<p>After truly considering entering computer science, I came to one realization: computer science, depending on
					my perspective, could be just as freeing. If I could apply my creative knowledge to technology, then
					I can make my experience with computer science as unrestrained as art.</p>
					<p> And here I am. In hopes of crafting a creative relationship with technology, I'm also pursuing an additional major in Human-Computer Interaction. I strongly believe that technology
					can be made infinitely better with smarter design. Moreover, technology should serve society, and to do so,
					we must remain attentive to the users throughout the creation process.</p>
					
					<p><strong>My Home Base:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Portland, Oregon</p>
					<p>Surrounded by evergreen trees, fresh blueberries, wild salmon, and the purest water you will ever taste. 
					My childhood was a dream. Come experience the natural wonders of the Pacific Northwest :)</p>

						<div class="col-6 col-12-mobilep">
							<p><strong>Morals</strong></p>
							<ul>
								<li>Be respectful and kind. Truly, stand in other people's shoes and
									view the world from their perspective.</li>
								<li>Be aware of your actions and the connotations they bear. Your words
									and actions may not always mean the same to others as they do to you.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class="col-6 col-12-mobilep">
							<p><strong>Values</strong></p>
							<ul>
								<li>Appreciate the beauty in the world. Take in the smiles of the people you
								walk by; the breath of air you just inhaled; and the breath of air you just exhaled.</li>
								<li>Appreciate the privileges you've been given. Value your access to education, a home, 
								and food. We live amazing, wonderful lives, even if they aren't as perfect as we may wish.</li>
								<li>Appreciate the present. As someone who very much used to live in the future, I try as much as
								I can to live in the now. Aspirations are necessary, but present life
								is pretty great as well.</li>
							</ul>
