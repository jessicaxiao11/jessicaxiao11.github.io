								<h2>Hello, I'm Jessica :)</h2>
							</header>
							<p>As a mere eighteen year old college student, I'm just starting to find my way around.
							I still stare at the world in wonder, absorbing the spectacularity of our lives.</p>
							<p>Usually, I spend my time grasping the new knowledge that my classes present to me. Admittedly, the 
							curriculum is intense, but I must also admit that I relish every challenge I'm given. 
							In fact, my interest in Computer Science initially grew from the satisfaction I experienced through every
							math problem I solved. You may find this surprising, though, that my ultimate decision to enter
							the field of computer science was due to my love for art. </p>

					<p>As much as I loved math, I had an equally budding passion for art. In some instances,
					math felt extremely constricting; after all, it's a subject composed of algorithms and obscure
					equations. Art, on the other hand, exposed me to the unlimited bounds of imagination, creativity, and
					freedom.</p>
					<p>After truly considering entering computer science, I came to one realization: computer science, depending on
					my perspective, could be just as freeing. If I could apply my creative knowledge to technology, then
					I can make my experience with computer science as unrestrained as art.</p>
					<p> And here I am. In hopes of crafting a creative relationship with technology, I'm planning to 
					pursue an additional major in Human Computer Interaction. I strongly believe that technology
					can be made infinitely better with smart design. Moreover, technology must serve society, and to do so,
					we must remain attentive to the users throughout the creation process.</p>
